## Simpledimple.js ##

Aim of [simpledimple.js](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple) is to further simplify the use of powerful visualization library [dimple](http://dimplejs.org/).

[Simpledimple.js](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple)

    * Separates the configuration of properties of charts from JavaScript code
    * Facilitates externalization of the parameters of a chart thus opening the possibilities of:
        * Interactive tools based designing of charts
        * External storage and
        * Exchange of charts

[Simpledimple.js](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple) is a wrapper around dimple's API. This wrapper accepts the entire configuration of a chart (E.g., parameters of axis, series etc.) as a single JavaScript object and internally handles the calls to be made to [dimple](http://dimplejs.org/). Following is an example chart configuration:

    var chartConfig = {
        width: 590,
        height: 400,
        bounds: {
            x: 70,
            y: 30,
            width: 505,
            height: 305
        },
        axes: [{
            position: "x",
            categoryFields: "Month",
            orderRules: [{ ordering: "Date" }]
        }, {
            position: "y",
            measure: "Unit Sales"
        }],
        series: [{
            plot: "area",
            interpolation: "step",
            lineWeight: 1
        }]
    };

  To draw a chart, you need to create a `simpledimple.chart` object and invoke `draw()` function of that chart object passing the chart configuration:

    var myChart = new simpledimple.chart("#chartContainer", chartConfig, data);
    myChart.draw();

## How do I load the code?

Simpledimple.js implements the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) pattern and so should be compatible with most approaches to script loading and dependency management: direct script loading with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) etc. For these options, you can grab it from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simpledimple) with `npm install simpledimple` or via [Bower](http://bower.io/) with `bower install simpledimple`.

If you are loading the scripts directly (as in the [examples](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple)), you need to:

1. Load the dependencies:
  1. d3  - `<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"></script>`
  2. dimple - `<script src="http://dimplejs.org/dist/dimple.v2.1.4.min.js"></script>`
2. Load the simpledimple.js files:
  1. `simpledimple.min.js`

Here is the source code of an [exmaple](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/simpledimple/blob/master/examples/area_steps_horizontal.html) 

## Where can I see the demo?

You can see the live demo at [examples page](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple/viewer/index.html).

## Is there an online tool to experiment and design my own charts?

Yes. You can use the [fiddle tool](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/simpledimple/fiddle/index.html) to:

    * Load sample or your own data
    * Browse and load sample chart configuration and edit
    * Verify and create your own charts


## How can I build the code and run the tests?

To install the development dependencies, just run `npm install`, which will create a `node_modules` directory with the files required to run the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) build system.

After modifying any of the `.js` files at the top of the repo, you can compile/minify the files into the `dist` directory by running `grunt` command. This also starts a webserver bound to port 3001 that can be used to list the examples using the URL: http://localhost:3001/examples/

## How can I contribute?

Pull requests are welcome! Here are some [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/simpledimple/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## I have a question, how can I get in touch?

Please first check the [issues](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/simpledimple/issues) that are already raised and if you can't find what you're looking for there, then please [create a GitHub  Issue](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/simpledimple/issues/new). When creating an issue, please try to provide a replicable test case so that others can more easily help you.
